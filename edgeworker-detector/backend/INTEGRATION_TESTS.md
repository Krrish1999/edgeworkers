# Integration Tests - Task 8

This document describes the comprehensive integration tests created for Task 8: "Create integration tests to verify end-to-end data flow".

## Overview

The integration tests verify the complete data flow from the data generator through InfluxDB to API responses, WebSocket broadcasting with multiple clients, and error scenarios including InfluxDB downtime and network issues.

## Requirements Coverage

### Primary Requirements (Task 8)
- **1.1**: Dashboard APIs return real-time metrics from InfluxDB
- **1.2**: APIs return current metrics within 30 seconds  
- **1.3**: Heatmap returns current PoP status
- **1.4**: Timeseries returns time-series data from InfluxDB
- **3.1**: WebSocket clients receive updated overview metrics within 10 seconds
- **3.2**: WebSocket clients receive updated regression counts

### Additional Requirements Covered
- **2.1**: System returns appropriate error responses when InfluxDB is unavailable
- **2.2**: System logs detailed error information for debugging
- **2.3**: System attempts to reconnect automatically when connection is lost
- **2.4**: System handles timeouts gracefully and returns error responses
- **3.3**: WebSocket broadcasts handle failures gracefully
- **3.4**: System optimizes performance when no clients are connected

- Final task completion verification

## Running the Tests

### Run All Integration Tests
```bash
npm test
# or
node run-integration-tests.js
```

### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# End-to-end integration tests
npm run test:e2e
# or
node test-end-to-end-integration.js

# WebSocket multi-client tests
npm run test:websocket
# or
node test-websocket-multiclient.js

# Error scenarios tests
npm run test:errors
# or
node test-error-scenarios.js
```

## Test Architecture

### Test Environment Setup
Each test suite creates its own isolated test environment:
- Dedicated HTTP server on unique ports (3002, 3003, 3004)
- Mock WebSocket servers with enhanced broadcast functionality
- Test InfluxDB clients with connection management
- Simulated data generation for testing

### Data Flow Testing
1. **Generator Simulation**: Creates test data points in InfluxDB
2. **API Verification**: Tests all dashboard endpoints for data retrieval
3. **WebSocket Testing**: Verifies real-time broadcasting functionality
4. **Error Simulation**: Tests system behavior under various failure conditions

### Error Scenario Testing
- **InfluxDB Downtime**: Simulates database unavailability
- **Network Timeouts**: Tests timeout handling and recovery
- **Circuit Breaker**: Verifies circuit breaker activation and recovery
- **Cache Fallback**: Tests multi-level cache and fallback mechanisms

## Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation
- All APIs return fresh data from InfluxDB
- WebSocket clients receive real-time updates
- Data is cached appropriately for performance
- Connection state is properly managed

### Error Conditions
- APIs return fallback data when InfluxDB is unavailable
- WebSocket broadcasting continues despite individual client failures
- Circuit breaker activates after repeated failures
- System recovers gracefully when services come back online

## Test Data

### Mock PoPs
The tests use a subset of test PoPs:
- `test_nyc`: New York (with simulated regressions)
- `test_lax`: Los Angeles  
- `test_lhr`: London

### Mock Metrics
- Cold start times: 3.5-5.5ms (normal), 8-14ms (regressed)
- Functions: auth-validator, content-optimizer, geo-redirect
- Timestamps: Current time with proper sequencing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**: Tests use ports 3002-3004. Ensure these are available.
2. **InfluxDB Connection**: Tests handle InfluxDB unavailability gracefully.
3. **Redis Connection**: Redis unavailability is handled with fallback mechanisms.
4. **MongoDB Connection**: MongoDB issues are handled with default values.

### Test Failures

If tests fail, check:
1. Service availability (InfluxDB, Redis, MongoDB)
2. Port availability for test servers
3. Network connectivity
4. System resources (memory, CPU)

### Debugging

Enable debug logging by setting environment variables:
```bash
DEBUG=true node run-integration-tests.js
```

## Success Criteria

### Task 8 Completion
The task is considered complete when:
- ✅ All test suites pass
- ✅ All specified requirements are verified
- ✅ Data flow from generator to API is confirmed
- ✅ WebSocket multi-client broadcasting works
- ✅ Error scenarios are handled appropriately

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: All major code paths tested
- **Error Handling**: All failure modes covered
- **Performance**: Response times within acceptable limits
- **Reliability**: Tests pass consistently across runs

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests are designed to be run in automated environments:
- No external dependencies required (uses fallback mechanisms)
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- Clear exit codes for automation
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the test suite:
1. **Load Testing**: Add high-volume concurrent request testing
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Add response time assertions
3. **Data Validation**: Add more detailed data structure validation
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Add metrics collection during tests
5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify behavior across different environments

## Conclusion

This comprehensive integration test suite ensures that Task 8 requirements are fully met and that the EdgeWorker monitoring system's end-to-end data flow is properly verified. The tests provide confidence in the system's reliability, error handling, and real-time capabilities.
