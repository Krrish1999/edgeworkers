# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The EdgeWorker monitoring dashboard currently displays various metrics cards and components without contextual help information. Users may not fully understand what each metric represents, how it's calculated, or what actions they should take based on the displayed data. Adding informational tooltips with "i" icons will improve user experience and help users better interpret the dashboard data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to see informational tooltips on metric cards, so that I can understand what each metric represents and how it's calculated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over an "i" icon on a metric card THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip with detailed information about that metric
2. WHEN I view the dashboard overview cards THEN each card SHALL have an "i" icon positioned appropriately
3. WHEN I click or tap the "i" icon on mobile devices THEN the tooltip SHALL appear and remain visible until dismissed
4. WHEN the tooltip is displayed THEN it SHALL include metric definition, calculation method, and interpretation guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want tooltips to work properly on touch devices, so that I can access help information regardless of my device type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap an "i" icon on a touch device THEN the tooltip SHALL appear immediately
2. WHEN a tooltip is open on mobile THEN I SHALL be able to dismiss it by tapping outside the tooltip area
3. WHEN multiple tooltips are available THEN only one tooltip SHALL be visible at a time
4. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN tooltips SHALL reposition appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want tooltips on complex components like the heat map and performance charts, so that I can understand the data visualization and take appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the Global Heat Map THEN there SHALL be an "i" icon explaining the color coding and status indicators
2. WHEN I view performance trend charts THEN there SHALL be tooltips explaining the metrics being displayed
3. WHEN I view the alerts widget THEN there SHALL be help information about alert severity levels and statuses
4. WHEN tooltips contain actionable information THEN they SHALL include relevant links or next steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the dashboard, I want a reusable tooltip component system, so that tooltips can be easily added to new components and maintained consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding tooltips to components THEN developers SHALL use a standardized InfoTooltip component
2. WHEN tooltip content is defined THEN it SHALL be stored in a centralized configuration for easy maintenance
3. WHEN tooltips are rendered THEN they SHALL follow consistent styling and positioning rules
4. WHEN new components are added THEN tooltip integration SHALL be straightforward and well-documented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a UX designer, I want tooltips to be visually consistent and accessible, so that they enhance rather than disrupt the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tooltips are displayed THEN they SHALL follow the existing design system colors and typography
2. WHEN tooltips appear THEN they SHALL have proper contrast ratios for accessibility compliance
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN tooltips SHALL be accessible via Tab and Enter keys
4. WHEN tooltips contain long content THEN they SHALL be properly sized and positioned to avoid viewport overflow
