# WebSocket Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the WebSocket improvements implemented to enhance real-time broadcasting system reliability and connection management.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Broadcast Interval Alignment ✅

- **Before**: WebSocket broadcasts every 5 seconds
- **After**: WebSocket broadcasts every 10 seconds (aligned with data generation frequency)
- **Benefit**: Reduces unnecessary queries and ensures fresh data is available for each broadcast

### 2. Enhanced Connection State Management ✅

#### Connection Tracking
- Each WebSocket connection gets a unique ID: `ws_{counter}_{timestamp}`
- Connection metadata stored in `wsConnections` Map:
  ```javascript
  {
    id: 'ws_1_1234567890',
    connectedAt: Date,
    lastBroadcast: Date,
    broadcastCount: number,
    errorCount: number,
    lastError: string,
    clientInfo: {
      userAgent: string,
      ip: string
    }
  }
  ```

#### Connection Lifecycle Management
- **Connection**: Assigns unique ID, stores metadata, sends welcome message
- **Message Handling**: Processes ping/pong and subscription requests
- **Disconnection**: Logs connection stats and cleans up metadata
- **Error Handling**: Tracks errors per connection without terminating service

### 3. Error Recovery and Resilience ✅

#### Broadcast Error Recovery
- Individual client failures don't stop broadcasts to other clients
- Failed broadcasts are logged with client ID for debugging
- Connection statistics track success/failure rates
- Service continues operating even if all clients fail

#### Connection Health Monitoring
- Periodic ping/pong to detect stale connections
- Automatic cleanup of connections inactive for >5 minutes
- Connection health stats logged every minute when clients are connected

#### Graceful Error Handling
- Try/catch blocks around all WebSocket operations
- Detailed error logging with connection context
- Fallback responses when InfluxDB is unavailable
- Non-blocking error recovery (errors don't crash the service)

### 4. Graceful Client Disconnection Handling ✅

#### Clean Disconnection
- Proper close event handling with code and reason logging
- Connection statistics summary on disconnect
- Automatic cleanup of connection metadata
- Remaining client count tracking

#### Graceful Server Shutdown
- Sends shutdown notification to all connected clients
- Closes all WebSocket connections with proper close codes
- Clears connection tracking data
- Coordinates with HTTP server shutdown

## New API Endpoints

### WebSocket Status Endpoint
```
GET /api/websocket/status
```

Returns detailed WebSocket connection information:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-09T...",
  "summary": {
    "activeConnections": 3,
    "trackedConnections": 3,
    "totalBroadcasts": 45,
    "totalErrors": 2
  },
  "connections": [
    {
      "id": "ws_1_1234567890",
      "connectedAt": "2025-02-09T...",
      "broadcastCount": 15,
      "errorCount": 0,
      "lastBroadcast": "2025-02-09T...",
      "lastError": null,
      "clientInfo": {
        "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
        "ip": "127.0.0.1"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Enhanced Health Check
The existing `/health` endpoint now includes WebSocket status:
```json
{
  "services": {
    "websocket": {
      "healthy": true,
      "activeConnections": 3,
      "totalConnectionsTracked": 3
    }
  }
}
```

## Message Types

### Server to Client Messages
- `welcome`: Connection confirmation with connection ID
- `metrics_update`: Real-time metrics data
- `error`: Error notifications
- `pong`: Response to client ping
- `subscription_confirmed`: Subscription acknowledgment
- `server_shutdown`: Graceful shutdown notification

### Client to Server Messages
- `ping`: Connection health check
- `subscribe`: Topic subscription request

## Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Broadcasting
- Skip InfluxDB queries when no clients are connected
- Batch connection updates during broadcasts
- Minimal memory footprint for connection tracking
- Efficient cleanup of stale connections

### Resource Management
- Automatic cleanup of closed connections
- Periodic health checks prevent resource leaks
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Optimized query execution with timeouts

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
- Connection lifecycle events (connect/disconnect)
- Broadcast success/failure rates
- Error details with connection context
- Performance metrics (broadcast timing, client counts)

### Metrics
- Active connection count
- Broadcast success rate
- Error frequency per connection
- Connection duration statistics

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Enhanced broadcast function logic
- Connection state management
- Error recovery scenarios
- Stale connection cleanup

### Integration Tests
- Multi-client connection handling
- Real-time message broadcasting
- Error resilience testing
- Graceful shutdown procedures

## Requirements Compliance

This implementation satisfies all requirements from the task:

✅ **3.1**: WebSocket clients receive updated overview metrics within 10 seconds  
✅ **3.2**: WebSocket clients receive updated regression counts when PoPs experience issues  
✅ **3.3**: System logs errors and continues broadcasting when WebSocket broadcasts fail  
✅ **3.4**: System skips unnecessary InfluxDB queries when no WebSocket clients are connected  

## Usage

The WebSocket improvements are automatically active when the backend server starts. Clients can connect to the WebSocket endpoint and will receive:

1. Welcome message with connection ID
2. Real-time metrics updates every 10 seconds
3. Error notifications when issues occur
4. Graceful shutdown notifications

No changes are required to existing client code - the improvements are backward compatible with the existing WebSocket API.
