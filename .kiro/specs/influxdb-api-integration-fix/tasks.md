# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix critical bugs preventing proper operation
  - Fix the typo in RegressionDetector cron schedule that prevents it from starting
  - Add RegressionDetector service initialization to the main app.js startup sequence
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 2. Enhance InfluxDB connection reliability and error handling
  - Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff to influxdb.js utility
  - Implement query timeout handling for all InfluxDB operations
  - Add structured logging for connection state changes and query performance
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Optimize dashboard API Flux queries for better performance
  - Simplify the complex multi-yield query in dashboard overview endpoint
  - Add query result caching using Redis for frequently accessed data
  - Standardize field names and measurement names across all queries
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Improve WebSocket real-time broadcasting system
  - Align WebSocket broadcast interval with data generation frequency (10 seconds)
  - Add connection state management and graceful client disconnection handling
  - Implement error recovery for failed broadcasts without stopping the service
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Enhance data generator monitoring and validation
  - Add write confirmation logging to verify successful InfluxDB writes
  - Implement health check endpoint for monitoring data generator status
  - Add exponential backoff retry logic for failed InfluxDB write operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Integrate regression detection with real-time alerts
  - Ensure RegressionDetector service starts automatically with the application
  - Add WebSocket notifications for newly created alerts to provide real-time updates
  - Implement automatic alert resolution when performance returns to normal levels
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 7. Add comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Implement Redis caching fallback when InfluxDB queries fail
  - Add circuit breaker pattern for InfluxDB connections to prevent cascade failures
  - Create default response data for API endpoints when database is unavailable
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 8. Create integration tests to verify end-to-end data flow
  - Write tests to verify data flows from generator through InfluxDB to API responses
  - Add tests for WebSocket broadcasting with multiple connected clients
  - Create tests for error scenarios including InfluxDB downtime and network issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2_
